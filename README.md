# AI powered bots on social media
This is a group project of Data Science and Public Policy course at Columbia University.

Our analysis focused on a dataset containing information about a bot network on Twitter that utilized ChatGPT to produce human-like content. We conducted a comparative analysis between messages posted by AI-powered bots and those generated by humans. Our aim was to assess their similarities and to examine the engagement patterns of both bot and human accounts.

Overall, we observed that human behavior tends to exhibit greater variance, while bots demonstrate more uniform behavior.
